Contributing code

Please make sure that your change focuses on the problem it is trying to solve, with minimal number of changes.

Observe the coding style when modifying or adding files. Having an [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) enabled editor will take some of the pain out if this.

Run the unit tests and examples with your code change.

Submit the change with a descriptive message. What's fixed? What's changed and how? What's added? What's removed?
